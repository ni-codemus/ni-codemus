# 👋 Hi, I’m <b>@ni-codemus</b>

I’m interested in software engineering, cybersecurity, and low-level systems.

I currently focus on reverse engineering, operating systems fundamentals, and security concepts, while preparing for the CompTIA Security+ certification.  
Alongside this, I train and practice in software development and DevOps, working with tools such as Ansible, Terraform, Docker, and Kubernetes.

I enjoy working close to the system: understanding how things work internally, breaking them, and improving their security. I’m particularly interested in the intersection between technology, healthcare, and critical systems.

I’m open to collaborating on projects related to security, system programming, DevOps, or infrastructure automation.
